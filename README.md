This is a binary classification of great books, defined as those with at least 50 ratings and in the top 20% of Wilson-adjusted ratings. (For more details, see build_2.ipynb.) The data was pulled on July 30th, 2020 via goodreads-api-client-python, a lightweight wrapper around the Goodreads API built by [Michelle D Zhang](https://github.com/mdzhang). Its code and documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/mdzhang/goodreads-api-client-python).
